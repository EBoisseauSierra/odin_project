# Odin Project & Etienne's work 
> Welcome to this repo where I push my code, when pursuing the Oding Project!

## What is this about
You'll find in this repo most of the work I have carried out as part of [*The Odin Project*](http://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.
You can observe my improvement as I progress through lessons.

If you're currently into The Odin Project, please have a look and feel free to pinch ideas.
However, be aware that all code is not perfect and some of it is sometimes messy.
Some code just serve as a proof of concept to validate the milestone, but could easily be tidied up and refined.
For some other project, I however took more time to optimize my output.

Moreover, don't hesitate to send feedback and suggest improvement, I'd be glad to progress!


## How to explore
The structure of the repo is similar to [the hierarchy](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses) of TOP curriculum.
You should easily find what you're looking for.
